# `mach` — the command-line interface

```
mach <command> [options]
```

The compiler dispatches on `argv[1]`. With no command, or an unknown one, it
prints usage and exits non-zero. Every command except `init` runs from inside a
project tree: it walks up from the working directory until a `mach.toml` is
found.

This page documents the flags the current binary actually parses. Flags are
matched exactly: `--flag value` (a value follows in the next argument) or a bare
`--flag` toggle. The combined `--flag=value` form and bundled short flags are
**not** recognized.

## Commands

| Command | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| `build` | compile the project to objects and (in executable mode) a linked binary |
| `run`   | build, then execute the produced binary |
| `test`  | build the test binary and run the collected tests |
| `dep`   | manage git-backed dependencies (clone, lock, vendor) under `<dir_dep>` |
| `init`  | scaffold a new project |
| `doc`   | generate Markdown reference docs from source doc-comments |
| `help`  | print usage; `mach help <command>` for detail |

## Global flags

Read by `build`, `run`, `test`, and `doc` (they share one config parser).
`--verbose` and `--quiet` together is a parse error.

| Flag             | Value            | Effect |
|------------------|------------------|--------|
| `--verbose`, `-v`| —                | write extra detail (per-stage compile progress) to stderr |
| `--quiet`, `-q`  | —                | suppress non-error output |
| `--color <mode>` | `auto`\|`always`\|`never` | color preference for terminal output (default `auto`); an unknown mode is a parse error |
| `--cwd <path>`   | path             | run as if started in `<path>` (project-root search begins there) |
| `--target <name>`| target name      | select a `[targets.<name>]` entry; absent, defers to `[project].target` |
| `-o <path>`      | path             | override the linked-binary path, rooted at the project root (build/run/test) |
| `--artifacts <dir>` | dir           | override the per-target object directory, rooted at `<dir_out>` (build/run/test) |
| `--emit-asm`     | —                | emit per-module assembly text (`.s`) beside each object |
| `--emit-ir`      | —                | emit per-module SSA IR text (`.ir`) beside each object |
| `--verify-ir`    | —                | run the IR verifier after each optimisation pass |

> `mach dep` and `mach init` do not use the shared config parser; they read only
> their own flags listed below.

## `mach build`

```
mach build [options]
```

Compiles the current project. Every reachable module is driven through
sema → lower → optimise → codegen to one relocatable object, written to
`<dir_out>/<artifacts>/obj/<fqn-as-path>.o`. In executable mode the objects are
linked into `<dir_out>/<binary>`; in library mode (or with `--emit obj`) the
objects are the deliverable and nothing is linked.

| Flag           | Value          | Effect |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| `--release`    | —              | select the release optimisation pipeline |
| `-O0`          | —              | force the debug pipeline (overrides `--release`) |
| `-O1`          | —              | select the release pipeline |
| `-O2`          | —              | select the release pipeline |
| `--emit <kind>`| `obj`\|`exe`   | `obj` stops at the relocatable objects; `exe` (default) links a binary |
| `-L <dir>`     | dir            | add a search directory for `-l`-resolved inputs; repeatable |
| `-l <name>`    | name           | link a named object or archive, resolved through the `-L` dirs (see below); repeatable |
| *(positional)* | input path     | a bare argument that contains `/` or ends in `.o` / `.a` is linked verbatim |

Plus the global flags above. The `-O<n>` flags override `--release` when both
are present; absent any optimisation flag the build uses the debug pipeline
(the bootstrap-stable default). `-O1` and `-O2` currently select the same
release pipeline.

### External link inputs

`ext fun` declarations are forward references whose definitions are supplied at
link time by external precompiled code — a loose `.o` object or a static `.a`
archive. Those inputs come from the command line and from the target's
`[targets.*].libs` manifest field (see [manifest.md](manifest.md)); both sets are
linked. An input that resolves to no existing file is a hard error, so a typo
never silently drops a dependency.

- **Explicit input path** — a bare (non-flag) argument that contains a `/` or
  ends in `.o` (object) or `.a` (archive) is treated as an input path. The first
  non-flag positional after `build` is the project root and is skipped; remaining
  input-path positionals are link inputs. A relative path is tried verbatim
  against the working directory first, then rooted at the project root.
- **`-l <name>`** — resolves to an object or archive. Each `-L <dir>` is searched
  for `<dir>/lib<name>.o`, `<dir>/<name>.o`, `<dir>/lib<name>.a`, then
  `<dir>/<name>.a`; if none hit, the same four candidates relative to the working
  directory are tried. Loose objects are preferred over archives.
- **`-L <dir>`** — adds a search directory for the `-l` resolution above. Both
  `-L` and `-l` may be repeated.

A static `.a` archive contributes every one of its member objects to the link
(all members are pulled, not just those satisfying an undefined symbol). Shared
libraries (`.so`) are not supported. Manifest `libs` are resolved before the CLI
inputs, giving a stable, deterministic link order.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` user error (no `mach.toml`, unknown target, compile
errors, an unresolvable link input), `2` internal error.

## `mach run`

```
mach run [options] [-- args...]
```

Builds the project exactly like `mach build`, then executes the produced binary.
Arguments after a `--` separator are forwarded to the child as its `argv`. The
child's exit code becomes this command's exit code.

`--emit` is rejected — running a relocatable object is not meaningful. All other
`build` and global flags apply.

Exit codes: the child's exit code, `1` on a build/user error, `2` on internal
error.

## `mach test`

```
mach test [options]
```

Builds a test binary — a synthesized runner over every `test` declaration the
resolver collected, replacing the project's own entry point — then runs it.
A test build always links an executable, even for a library target.

| Flag                | Value   | Effect |
|---------------------|---------|--------|
| `--filter <pattern>`| pattern | forwarded to the runner: run only tests whose name matches `<pattern>` |
| `--list`            | —       | forwarded to the runner: list the collected tests and exit |

Plus the `build` and global flags. `--filter`/`--list` are passed through to the
test runner as its argv; the runner itself selects or enumerates the tests.

Exit codes: `0` all passed, `1` any failed, `2` build/internal error.

## `mach dep`

```
mach dep <action> [args]
```

Manages git-backed dependencies under `<dir_dep>`. Dispatches on `argv[2]`. A
dependency is a git URL plus a ref; `mach dep` clones it into
`<dir_dep>/<alias>/` and records the resolved commit in a lockfile.

| Action   | Args | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| `list`   | — | print each `[deps.<alias>]` entry from `mach.toml`, with its `url=` and `ref=` |
| `add`    | `<alias> <url> [--ref <ref>]` | append a `[deps.<alias>]` entry to `mach.toml`, then `sync` |
| `remove` | `<alias> [--purge]` | drop the entry from `mach.toml` and `mach.lock`; `--purge` also deletes `<dir_dep>/<alias>/` |
| `sync`   | — | fetch every declared dep into `<dir_dep>/<alias>/`, honouring `mach.lock` |
| `vendor` | — | alias for `sync` — materialise all deps under `<dir_dep>` for committing into the project |

### Git fetch

`mach dep` shells out to the `git` on `PATH` (resolved by scanning `$PATH`, since
the process spawn API uses `execve` with no path search). For each declared git
dependency `sync`:

1. clones the `url` into `<dir_dep>/<alias>/` if no clone is present there;
2. checks out the `ref` as a **detached HEAD** (`git checkout --detach`), so the
   working tree sits on a concrete commit;
3. reads the resolved commit SHA from `<alias>/.git/HEAD` and records it.

The child process receives an allowlisted environment (`PATH`, `HOME`, and the
common git/ssh/proxy/CA variables) so https and ssh transports work.

A `ref` is resolved as: an explicit `tag/<name>` or `branch/<name>`; a bare name
auto-detected as a branch (resolved against `origin/<name>` so a moved branch
tracks its tip) or a tag; or a 7–40 char hex commit SHA checked out directly.

### Lockfile (`mach.lock`)

After a successful `sync`, `mach dep` writes `mach.lock` — a TOML file recording
each git dep's `url`, `ref`, and resolved `commit`:

```toml
# generated by `mach dep sync`; do not edit by hand.
version = 1

[deps.mach-std]
url = "https://github.com/octalide/mach-std"
ref = "branch/dev"
commit = "6b78ae1e8c3c9cc45e4ab4b916fd191d61e76aff"
```

On the next `sync`, a dep with a `commit` in `mach.lock` is checked out at that
exact commit for reproducibility; delete its lock entry (or the file) to let the
declared `ref` re-resolve to its current tip. Commit `mach.lock` to pin builds.

### Backward compatibility

`sync` only manages directories it cloned (where `<alias>/.git` is a directory).
A hand-vendored source tree, a symlink, or a git **submodule** (whose `.git` is a
file) is reported as `vendored <alias> (skipped)`, left untouched, and excluded
from the lockfile. This is how the compiler's own `dep/mach-std` submodule is
preserved.

`mach dep list` reads `mach.toml` from the current directory directly (it does
not walk up to find a project root). Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` user error, `2`
internal error.

## `mach init`

```
mach init [dir] [options]
```

Scaffolds a new project in `[dir]` (default: the current directory). Writes a
minimal `mach.toml` with a `[project]` block and a `[targets.host]` entry
matching the running compiler, a starter source file, and an empty `dep/`
directory. Refuses to overwrite an existing `mach.toml` unless `--force`.

| Flag           | Value | Effect |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| `--name <name>`| name  | project id (default: the directory base name) |
| `--force`      | —     | scaffold even when a `mach.toml` already exists |
| `--lib`        | —     | library layout: write `src/lib.mach` instead of `src/main.mach`, and omit `entrypoint` from the manifest |

The first non-flag argument after `init` is the target directory.

> The scaffolded manifest omits the `binary` key (and, with `--lib`, the
> `entrypoint` key too) — both of which a build requires. A scaffolded project
> therefore needs its `[targets.host]` entry completed before `mach build`
> succeeds. See [manifest.md](manifest.md) for the required keys.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` user error, `2` internal error.

## `mach doc`

```
mach doc [options]
```

Loads the project's module graph and generates Markdown reference docs from
source doc-comments — one page per module plus an index. Each `pub` declaration
is paired with the run of `#` comment lines immediately preceding it. The
hand-written `doc/language/` material is never touched.

| Flag             | Value | Effect |
|------------------|-------|--------|
| `--out <dir>`    | dir   | output directory, rooted at the project (default `doc/api`) |
| `--target <name>`| name  | select a `[targets.<name>]` entry for module discovery |

Plus the global flags. Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` user error, `2` internal error.

## `mach help`

```
mach help [command]
```

Prints the top-level usage summary, or — with a known `[command]` — that
command's detail page. An unknown command prints the top-level usage and exits
non-zero.
