# Types

Mach has a small set of compiler-shipped concrete types plus a uniform
type-construction grammar for pointers, arrays, and function types. There
are no compiler-known type aliases — names like `bool`, `usize`, and `str`
are stdlib `def`s.

## Primitive scalars

| Family | Members |
|---|---|
| Unsigned int | `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64` |
| Signed int | `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` |
| Float | `f32`, `f64` |
| Untyped pointer | `ptr` |

These eleven names are the complete set of compiler-seeded primitive types.

There is no compiler `bool`. `bool` is a stdlib `def bool: u8;` with `true` /
`false` as stdlib `val`s (`1` / `0`) — see [def.md](def.md).

## SIMD vectors

> **Not yet implemented.** The vector type grammar below describes the
> planned design. The compiler does not seed vector types today; a name
> like `f32x4` resolves as an ordinary (unbound) identifier, not a type.

The planned design extends primitive numeric types into vectors by
appending `x<count>`:

```mach
f32x4           # 4 lanes of f32
i32x8           # 8 lanes of i32
u8x16           # 16 lanes of u8
```

The grammar is `<u|i|f><width>(x<count>)*`. Higher dimensions
(`f32x4x4`) are legal grammatically; the compiler ships only the entries
its target backends can accelerate.

## Pointer

`*T` — pointer to a value of type `T`.

```mach
var x: i64;
var p: *i64 = ?x;       # address-of yields a pointer
val v: i64  = @p;       # dereference reads through it
```

## Array

`[N]T` — array of exactly `N` values of type `T`. Nested: `[N][M]T`.

```mach
val a: [4]i64    = [4]i64{1, 2, 3, 4};
val g: [2][2]i64 = [2][2]i64{ [2]i64{1, 2}, [2]i64{3, 4} };
```

## Function type

`fun(T1, T2) R` — first-class function-pointer type.

```mach
def BinOp: fun(i64, i64) i64;
val op: BinOp = add;
val r:  i64   = op(2, 3);
```

## Record and union types

`rec` and `uni` declarations produce named types. See [rec.md](rec.md) and
[uni.md](uni.md).

## Type aliases

`def NAME: TYPE;` introduces an alias. See [def.md](def.md).
