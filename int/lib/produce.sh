# produce.sh — observable producers, sourced by run.sh.
#
# a producer turns a built case artifact into a normalized text observable on
# stdout, which run.sh diffs against the golden. the producer is the only thing
# that varies between verification modes; the golden-diff core does not change.
#
# producers:
#   exec        — run the program, observe its stdout (native / qemu).
#   relro-fault — run the program and report whether its write to a RELRO'd .rodata
#                 slot faulted (SIGSEGV -> exit 139); the --pie RELRO runtime guard.
#   field       — coreutils (od/dd) reads of known header offsets, for format facts
#                 execution cannot observe (PE ASLR bit, macho PIE bit). dispatched
#                 on the artifact's own magic, so it is independent of how the case
#                 maps to a leg. no LLVM; reads little-endian fields (every runner is LE).
#   relro       — like field, but walks the ELF program headers for a PT_GNU_RELRO
#                 (the static-PIE RELRO region). ELF-only; used by the elf-relro guard.
#   flat-loader — load an os=freestanding, of=raw flat image via a tiny C loader
#                 (mmap + jump) and report the image's exit status.
#   built       — build-only: assert the tuple composed and emitted an artifact,
#                 for a cross-built target with no host runner (a freestanding
#                 aarch64/riscv64 image on the x86_64 leg). the observable is a
#                 constant, so the golden is the fact "it emitted".
#   debuginfo   — build the case with and without `-g` (run.sh builds both) and
#                 assert over the artifacts: llvm-dwarfdump --verify accepts the `-g`
#                 image and `-g` is loadable-byte additive (PT_LOAD segments identical).
#                 the one producer that needs external validators (llvm-dwarfdump,
#                 readelf); it runs only on the ELF debug-info legs, which install them.
#
# build-fails is a run-mode but not a producer: it asserts the compile is REJECTED
# and takes the compiler's 'error:' diagnostic as the observable. it is handled in
# run.sh (there is no artifact to run), noted here for discoverability.

# the directory this file lives in (int/lib), used to find flat_loader.c. resolved
# from the sourced path so it does not depend on run.sh's variables.
